`yourco.de` is part of the project [Open Domains](https://opendomains.github.io), which aims to provide **free subdomains** to every developer and their projects.
The project was inspired by [js.org](https://js.org).

## How can I get a subdomain?
Just fork this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/opendomains/yourco.de), add the desired `CNAME` to the `CNAMES.js` file, and open a pull request.

If everything is fine, your subdomain should be available to the world within a day.
